        <h1>Campus Space Race: Balloon Satellite Challenge</h1>
        <p>Experience the thrill of designing and launching a high-altitude balloon satellite. Compete with peers from colleges globally, push boundaries, and reach for the skies!</p>

        <h2>Race Guidelines</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and launch a high-altitude balloon satellite capable of traveling 1000+ km across the Earth before descending.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Composition:</strong> Teams can have up to 6 members, including undergraduate and graduate students. Having at least one faculty advisor is recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Limitation:</strong> Teams are allocated a maximum budget of $1000. Multiple attempts can be made, but each attempt's cost must remain under the $1000 limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Guidelines:</strong> Strict adherence to aviation laws, environmental regulations, and safety precautions is required.</li>
            <li><strong>Balloon Specifications:</strong> Teams can decide on the balloon material, volume, and type of gas filling, which will influence altitude and endurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Payload:</strong> Payloads can include scientific instruments or cameras but must remain under a specified weight limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking and Communication:</strong> Incorporate a system for tracking the balloon, with GPS and satellite communication being typical choices.</li>
            <li><strong>End of Mission Strategy:</strong> Implement a mechanism to safely terminate the flight if needed to prevent it from becoming a hazard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>What is the maximum altitude the balloon can reach?</dt>
            <dd>The average high-altitude balloon can reach altitudes between 18-37 km, but this can vary based on design and weather conditions.</dd>
            
            <dt>Can we collaborate with multiple colleges?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, cross-college collaborations are encouraged, but all participants should be registered under one team.</dd>
