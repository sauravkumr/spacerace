        <h2>Race Guidelines</h2>
        <!-- <img src="images/guidelines.jpg" alt="Students working on balloon satellite" class="sectionImage"> -->
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and launch a high-altitude balloon satellite, aiming for the maximum altitude without exceeding a $1000 budget.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Team Composition:</strong> Teams can have up to 6 members, including undergraduate and graduate students. You may also have a faculty advisor.</li>
            <li><strong>Budget Limitation:</strong> Teams are allocated a maximum budget of $1000. Multiple attempts can be made, but each attempt's cost must remain under the $1000 limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Guidelines:</strong> Strict adherence to aviation laws, environmental regulations, and safety precautions is required.</li>
            <li><strong>Balloon Specifications:</strong> Teams can decide on the balloon material, volume, and type of gas filling, which will influence altitude and endurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Payload:</strong> Payloads can include scientific instruments or cameras but must remain under a specified weight limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking and Communication:</strong> Incorporate a system for tracking the balloon, with GPS and satellite communication being typical choices.</li>
            <li><strong>End of Mission Strategy:</strong> Implement a mechanism to safely terminate the flight if needed to prevent it from becoming a hazard.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- FAA Approval Section -->
    <section id="faa-approval">
        <h2>FAA Approval</h2>
        <p>Compliance with regulatory authorities is a cornerstone of the College Space Race. Given that balloon satellites can reach significant altitudes and potentially interfere with other airspace activities, obtaining approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is essential.</p>
        <p>The FAA regulates the national airspace to ensure safety for all users, from commercial airliners to unmanned balloons. Before launching your satellite:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure you've gone through the necessary certification or notification processes with the FAA.</li>
            <li>Always monitor and track your balloon to avoid potential conflicts in the airspace.</li>
            <li>Adopt best practices and guidelines provided by the FAA to ensure a safe and compliant flight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, regulatory compliance isn't just about ticking boxes. It's about ensuring the safety of all airspace users and the people below. For detailed information, consult the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/" target="_blank">FAA's official website</a>.</p>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <section id="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>What is the maximum altitude the balloon can reach?</dt>
            <dd>The average high-altitude balloon can reach altitudes between 18-37 km, but this can vary based on design and weather conditions.</dd>
            
            <dt>Can we collaborate with multiple colleges?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, cross-college collaborations are encouraged, but all participants should be registered under one team.</dd>
